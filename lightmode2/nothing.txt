in the silence of the nature, i always wish to walk alone.
last day, i started the engine and gone through the light rain to the bank,
while returning the rain got harder and harder.
but, i didnt' felt frozen or even the cold.
my mind is like telling me,
"go! go! im not getting suffered, instead im enjoying the rain,
in the rain im forgetting to feel the cold 'coz i dont' have time to think of it.
and its' sure thaat no-one will notice if i cry right, it sounds so funy but 
even i dont have the time and reason to cry."
and it took a long 6 hours to get into a clarity.
but im sure that i dont' have anything, anyone, anywhere to say,
even i dont' have time for it.
but im sure im' not okey, bcoz' my mind never told me like that before.
i never argued with my mind, we both never got suffocated before. 
like the rain will show its full strength when we're about to meet the summer,
its getting too complicated.
